# NITC Open Elective Allocation Portal

The project seeks to implement a system that can help allot Open Electives to the final-year and pre-final year students of the undergraduate program in NIT Calicut. With many students applying for open electives each semester, it is crucial to have an impartial, transparent method of allocating subjects to the students.  This code repository contains 2 branches - frontend, showing the frontend code written using Next.js, and, backend, showing the backend code in flask.
